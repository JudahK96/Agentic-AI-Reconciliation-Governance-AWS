# Agentic-AI-Reconciliation-Governance-AWS
## Objective
This lab demonstrates how to design and implement an **agentic, event-driven AI system** for **data reconciliation, governance, and exception triage** using fully managed AWS services.
The goal was not to build a demo model, but to show **production-oriented decision-making**: separating deterministic data processing from AI reasoning, enforcing security best practices, enabling observability, and exposing results through an API that could support a real UI.
This design mirrors real enterprise use cases in **financial services, compliance, and operations**, where explain-ability, auditability, and cost control matter as much as AI capability.
